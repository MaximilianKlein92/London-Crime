        "We use a simple linear regression for each ward to model the trend in total crime over time. The model is trained on the monthly total crime counts for each ward. We then forecast the next month's value and compare it to the most recent month to calculate the percentage increase or decrease.\n",

        "\n",
        "### What Does a Negative Percentage Mean?\n",
        "A negative percentage increase means the model predicts a decrease in crime for the next month compared to the last month. This can help identify wards where crime is expected to fall, not just rise.\n",

This is done by aggregating the monthly counts for each category across all wards, then fitting a linear model to the time series for each category. The model then forecasts the value 12 months ahead from the last available month.\n",

        "- **Loaded and explored the London crime dataset** to understand its structure and content.\n",
        "- **Built two simple predictive models** using linear regression:\n",
        "  - The first model forecasts the percentage increase or decrease in total crime for each ward, helping to identify areas with rising or falling crime trends.\n",
        "  - The second model predicts the frequency of each crime category **one year into the future**, highlighting which types of crime may require more attention over a longer period.\n",
        "- **Saved the predictions to CSV files** for further analysis, reporting, or visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Interpret the Results\n",
        "- **PctIncrease (Model 1):**\n",
        "  - A positive value means the model predicts an increase in crime for the ward next month.\n",
        "  - A negative value means a decrease is predicted. This is possible if the trend in the data is downward or if there was a recent spike that the model expects to drop.\n",
        "  - Wards with the highest positive values may need more resources or attention.\n",
        "- **PredictedOneYearAhead (Model 2):**\n",
        "  - Shows the expected number of crimes for each category 12 months after the last available month.\n",
        "  - Categories with high or rising predictions may indicate emerging issues or persistent problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and Next Steps\n",
        "- **Model Simplicity:** These models use only linear trends and do not account for seasonality, external events, or other factors. They are intended as a baseline.\n",
        "- **Data Quality:** Predictions are only as good as the data. Outliers or missing data can affect results.\n",
        "- **Further Analysis:** Consider visualizing the predictions, comparing with actual future data, or using more advanced models (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest) for improved accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "- **Proactive Policing:** Early identification of rising crime trends can help authorities allocate resources more effectively.\n",
        "- **Community Awareness:** Public access to predictions can inform community safety initiatives.\n",
        "- **Baseline for Improvement:** Simple models provide a starting point for more sophisticated analytics in the future."
