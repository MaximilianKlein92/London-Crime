    "## 2. Model 1: Predict Percentage Increase in Crime by Ward (with Train/Test Split)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "We use a simple linear regression for each ward to model the trend in total crime over time. To properly evaluate model performance, we implement a train/test split:\n",
    "- **Training data**: The first ~80% of months (19 out of 24 months)\n",
    "- **Test data**: The last ~20% of months (5 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on the training period, then evaluated on the test period using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). After validation, we retrain on all available data to forecast the next month's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Linear Regression?\n",
    "Linear regression is a straightforward and interpretable method for time series forecasting when trends are roughly linear. It provides a baseline for more complex models and is easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Train/Test Split?\n",
    "A train/test split allows us to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. The MAE on the test set gives us a realistic measure of prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does a Negative Percentage Mean?\n",
    "A negative percentage increase means the model predicts a decrease in crime for the next month compared to the last month. This can help identify wards where crime is expected to fall, not just rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "The predictions are saved to `ward_crime_pct_increase_predictions.csv` and include:\n",
    "- `WardName`: The name of the ward\n",
    "- `LastMonth`: The total crime count in the most recent month\n",
    "- `PredictedNextMonth`: The model's forecast for the next month\n",
    "- `PctIncrease`: The percentage change (can be negative if a decrease is predicted)\n",
    "- `Test_MAE`: Mean absolute error on the test set for that ward"

    "The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set tells us, on average, how many crimes the model's predictions are off by when forecasting **unseen future months** for each ward. A **lower Test MAE** means the model generalizes well and can accurately predict crime trends it hasn't seen during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a good MAE?**\n",
    "- Compare the Test MAE to the ward's average monthly crime count (`LastMonth` column)\n",
    "- If Test MAE is 5-10% of the typical monthly crime count, the model is performing well\n",
    "- If Test MAE is 20%+ of monthly crimes, the model may struggle with that ward's variability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do some wards have higher errors?**\n",
    "- High-crime wards tend to have more variability and thus higher absolute errors\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "For the second model, we use linear regression to predict the frequency of each crime category **one year into the future**. To properly evaluate model performance, we implement a train/test split:\n",
    "- **Training data**: The first ~80% of months (19 out of 24 months)\n",
    "- **Test data**: The last ~20% of months (5 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on the training period, then evaluated on the test period using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). After validation, we retrain on all available data to forecast 12 months ahead from the last available month.\n",

    "This approach is simple and interpretable, making it easy to communicate results to stakeholders. It also provides a quick way to spot categories that are trending up or down, which can inform resource allocation and policy decisions.\n",

    "### Why Train/Test Split?\n",
    "A train/test split allows us to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data, ensuring our one-year forecasts are based on validated performance.\n",

    "The predictions are saved to `crime_category_frequency_1year_predictions.csv` and include:\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is a good MAE?**\n",
    "- Compare the Test MAE to the category's average monthly count (`LastMonth` column)\n",
    "- If Test MAE is 5-10% of the typical monthly count, the model performs well\n",
    "- If Test MAE is 20%+ of monthly crimes, the category may have high variability or non-linear trends\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do some categories have higher errors?**\n",
    "- High-volume crime categories (e.g., THEFT, VIOLENCE) have more variability and higher absolute errors\n",
    "- Categories with seasonal patterns or sudden changes are harder to predict with simple linear models\n",
    "- Lower-volume categories may have lower absolute MAE but can still show high percentage errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for One-Year Forecasts:**\n",
    "Since Model 2 predicts 12 months ahead (not just one month like Model 1), the test MAE helps us understand the model's baseline accuracy. Categories with low test errors are more reliable for long-term planning, while high-error categories may benefit from more sophisticated forecasting methods or additional features (e.g., seasonality adjustments)."

    "  - The first model forecasts the percentage increase or decrease in total crime for each ward, helping to identify areas with rising or falling crime trends.\n",
    "  - The second model predicts the frequency of each crime category **one year into the future**, highlighting which types of crime may require more attention over a longer period.\n",
    "- **Saved the predictions to CSV files** for further analysis, reporting, or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Interpret the Results\n",
    "- **PctIncrease (Model 1):**\n",
    "  - A positive value means the model predicts an increase in crime for the ward next month.\n",
    "  - A negative value means a decrease is predicted. This is possible if the trend in the data is downward or if there was a recent spike that the model expects to drop.\n",
    "  - Wards with the highest positive values may need more resources or attention.\n",
    "- **PredictedOneYearAhead (Model 2):**\n",
    "  - Shows the expected number of crimes for each category 12 months after the last available month.\n",
    "  - Categories with high or rising predictions may indicate emerging issues or persistent problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Next Steps\n",
    "- **Model Simplicity:** These models use only linear trends and do not account for seasonality, external events, or other factors. They are intended as a baseline.\n",
    "- **Data Quality:** Predictions are only as good as the data. Outliers or missing data can affect results.\n",
    "- **Model Performance:** Model 1 performs adequately for short-term ward-level predictions (median MAE of 13.78 crimes). However, Model 2 shows higher error rates for one-year forecasts, particularly for categories like PUBLIC ORDER OFFENCES (15.2% error), suggesting that more sophisticated methods like ARIMA or seasonal decomposition would be valuable future enhancements for long-term predictions.\n",
    "- **Further Analysis:** Consider visualizing the predictions, comparing with actual future data, or using more advanced models (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest) for improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "- **Proactive Policing:** Early identification of rising crime trends can help authorities allocate resources more effectively.\n",
    "- **Community Awareness:** Public access to predictions can inform community safety initiatives.\n",
    "- **Baseline for Improvement:** Simple models provide a starting point for more sophisticated analytics in the future."
