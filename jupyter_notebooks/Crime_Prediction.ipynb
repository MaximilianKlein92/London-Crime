        "- **Loaded and explored the London crime dataset** to understand its structure and content.\n",
        "- **Built two simple predictive models** using linear regression:\n",
        "  - The first model forecasts the percentage increase or decrease in total crime for each ward, helping to identify areas with rising or falling crime trends.\n",
        "  - The second model predicts the frequency of each crime category **one year into the future**, highlighting which types of crime may require more attention over a longer period.\n",
        "- **Saved the predictions to CSV files** for further analysis, reporting, or visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Interpret the Results\n",
        "- **PctIncrease (Model 1):**\n",
        "  - A positive value means the model predicts an increase in crime for the ward next month.\n",
        "  - A negative value means a decrease is predicted. This is possible if the trend in the data is downward or if there was a recent spike that the model expects to drop.\n",
        "  - Wards with the highest positive values may need more resources or attention.\n",
        "- **PredictedOneYearAhead (Model 2):**\n",
        "  - Shows the expected number of crimes for each category 12 months after the last available month.\n",
        "  - Categories with high or rising predictions may indicate emerging issues or persistent problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations and Next Steps\n",
        "- **Model Simplicity:** These models use only linear trends and do not account for seasonality, external events, or other factors. They are intended as a baseline.\n",
        "- **Data Quality:** Predictions are only as good as the data. Outliers or missing data can affect results.\n",
        "- **Further Analysis:** Consider visualizing the predictions, comparing with actual future data, or using more advanced models (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest) for improved accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "- **Proactive Policing:** Early identification of rising crime trends can help authorities allocate resources more effectively.\n",
        "- **Community Awareness:** Public access to predictions can inform community safety initiatives.\n",
        "- **Baseline for Improvement:** Simple models provide a starting point for more sophisticated analytics in the future."
